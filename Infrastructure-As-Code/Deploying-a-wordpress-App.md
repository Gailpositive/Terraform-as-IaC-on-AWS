# Deploying WordPress on AWS With Terraform.

### Using Terraform, we're setting up a reliable WordPress app in one place. It'll use a Multi-AZ setup for the database to make data safer and an auto-scaler for web hosting, adjusting based on how much the computer is being used

#### At The End Of This Project, I will Be Able To Understand the basic building blocks of Terraform (providers, data sources, resources, etc)
#### Develop Terraform project on Amazon Web Services
#### Getting started into a typical workflow for Terraform
#### Update and deploy changes into my infrastructure environment

## Architecture
<img width="707" alt="terraform aws image2 archetectual" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Terraform-as-IaC-on-AWS/assets/111061512/5b17031e-c2cf-4b04-9c84-41115624df4f">

### The AWS Services used:
* AWS Identity and Access Management  (AWS IAM) - securely manage identities and access to AWS services and resources
* Amazon Virtual Private Cloud  (Amazon VPC) - define and launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual environment
* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  (Amazon EC2) - provides scalable computing capacity
* Amazon Relational Database Service  (Amazon RDS) - fully managed, open-source cloud database service that allows you to * easily operate and scale your relational database
* Amazon Simple Storage Service  (Amazon S3) - object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance
* Amazon Elastic File System  (Amazon EFS) - serverless, fully elastic file storage
* AWS Simple Systems Manager  (SSM) - operations hub for your AWS applications and resources and a secure end-to-end management solution
* AWS Secrets Manager  - manage, retrieve, and rotate database credentials, tokens, API keys, and other secrets
* AWS Certificate Manager  (ACM) - provision and manage SSL/TLS certificates with AWS services and connected resources
* Amazon CloudFront  - content delivery network (CDN) service built for high performance, security, and developer convenience

## Heads Up
* Quick links to the AWS console are using the us-east-1 as the base region. It is highly recommended that the instance profile AWSCloud9SSMInstanceProfile and the IAM role AWSCloud9SSMAccessRole must not exist on the account prior starting this project.

* Check if the instance profile AWSCloud9SSMInstanceProfile exist by entering the following in an AWS CloudShell terminal. If it returns a non-empty response, then the instance profile AWSCloud9SSMInstanceProfile exist.
* aws iam list-instance-profiles | grep AWSCloud9SSMInstanceProfile
### You can delete the instance profile at your own risk, by entering following in an AWS CloudShell terminal.
* aws iam detach-role-policy --role-name AWSCloud9SSMAccessRole --policy-arn $(aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name AWSCloud9SSMAccessRole --output text | awk '{ print $2 }')
* aws iam remove-role-from-instance-profile --instance-profile-name AWSCloud9SSMInstanceProfile --role-name AWSCloud9SSMAccessRole
* aws iam delete-role --role-name AWSCloud9SSMAccessRole
* aws iam delete-instance-profile --instance-profile-name AWSCloud9SSMInstanceProfile

* To confirm I am using the IAM role attached to the environment EC2 instance,
* I run the command "aws sts get-caller-identity --no-cli-pager"
<img width="929" alt="114" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Terraform-as-IaC-on-AWS/assets/111061512/d930c373-71ee-4f7d-8ad1-80feebaefd55">

 ### STEP 5: Create And Update Input Variables, Provider, Local Values, And Data Sources
* cd terraform
<img width="948" alt="115" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Terraform-as-IaC-on-AWS/assets/111061512/a871b01d-307e-487a-a420-f8456067cfa0">

* Open variables.tf in the terraform folder
* Update the content and save
* Creating three input variables in the variable.tf file which define the number of availability zones, namespace, and VPC CIDR block to be used for this Terraform project's deployment
<img width="957" alt="116" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Terraform-as-IaC-on-AWS/assets/111061512/e7f0065e-6001-40b4-a2f7-d3d488fd59ae">

* Open providers.tf in the terraform folder
* Update the content and save
* I am requiring that the provider used in this project to be aws, the version of the hashicorp/aws provider must be a version greater than or equal to 5.0, and that all resources created by Terraform will be tagged with Key: Management, Value: Terraform.
<img width="950" alt="117" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Terraform-as-IaC-on-AWS/assets/111061512/d9de3089-35aa-4c81-9145-b70f9fad7075">

* Open main.tf in the terraform folder
* Update the content and save
* The update to main.tf begins by creating local variables that define the VPC availability zone and CIDR block values, RDS instance values, EC2 instance type, and credentials for the Wordpress Admin user.
* Next, the file defines data sources to look up definitions of the given AWS environment such as the current region, list of availability zones, ARNs of IAM policies, etc which will be used to create AWS resources.

### STEP 6: Create and deploy IAM resources to enable EC2 instances to read from an S3 bucket and grant full access permissions to RDS resources to be created later.

<img width="916" alt="aws vpc image" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Terraform-as-IaC-on-AWS/assets/111061512/344b68bf-4f96-4143-810d-07e4c707f649">

* Open main.tf in the terraform folder
* Append the content and save
* By updating the main.tf, I am creating IAM roles(aws_iam_role)
* And instance profiles (  aws_iam_instance_profile - an IAM EC2 Instance profile of a IAM role to attach to an EC2 instance )  from the data sources loaded in the previous step
* And performing a terraform apply to deploy the resources into my AWS environment.
* Run the command terraform init to fetch the provider to create resources
* Run the command terraform validate to validate syntax
* Run the command terraform plan to plan the deployment
* Run the command terraform apply to apply the deployment. Type 'yes' to confirm the action
<img width="955" alt="119" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Terraform-as-IaC-on-AWS/assets/111061512/6063879b-8845-4a36-a6fe-6cd7e72cf5f1">

* In the Tag tab,  the role is tagged with Key: Management, Value: Terraform, from previous section that all resources created by Terraform has been configured with this tag.
<img width="914" alt="124c" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Terraform-as-IaC-on-AWS/assets/111061512/7142f02d-b51d-46b7-9ec1-803fa069fd39">

* To quickly confirm the successful creation of the instance profiles,
* I run the following command: app-profile, web-hosting-profile
* "aws iam get-instance-profile --instance-profile-name app-profile | grep InstanceProfile -q && echo "Successfully created app-profile" || echo "Creation of app-profile was successful"
* aws iam get-instance-profile --instance-profile-name web-hosting-profile | grep InstanceProfile -q && echo "Successfully created web-hosting-profile" || echo "Creation of web-hosting-profile was unsuccessful"

<img width="948" alt="125 instance profile successful" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Terraform-as-IaC-on-AWS/assets/111061512/282e5a2b-37b0-4088-beb8-61eab6976bda">

### STEP 7: Create and deploy networking resources for hosting an application, involving the creation of a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with all essential resources to run a sample application

<img width="665" alt="networking vpc image" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Terraform-as-IaC-on-AWS/assets/111061512/119e86c5-6a21-451b-9563-319e493373ab">

### Creating Resources

### STEP 7: Create and deploy security resources, including Security Groups and VPC endpoints, within my VPC. VPC endpoints facilitate private connections to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services through AWS PrivateLink. Amazon VPC instances can communicate with service resources without needing public IP addresses, and the traffic stays within the Amazon network.

<img width="729" alt="security images" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Terraform-as-IaC-on-AWS/assets/111061512/1921c6d6-5fbe-446d-a6a5-b872abe2d310">
