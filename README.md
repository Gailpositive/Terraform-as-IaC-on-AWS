### What is Terraform?
* Terraform  is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you provision resources safely and efficiently. This is defined in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse and re-share. It creates and manages resources on cloud platforms and other services through their application programming interfaces (APIs). Terraform provide developers the ability to architect and to deploy a reliable, reproducible, and repeatable infrastructure.

* The Terraform Configuration Language  or Hashicorp's Configuration Language (HCL) is used to declare resources which represent infrastructure objects. These configuration files will tell Terraform the plugins to install, infrastructure to create, and the data to get.
